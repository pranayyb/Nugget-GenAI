# Nugget AI Assistant - Restaurant Chatbot

A RAG-powered intelligent chatbot that helps users ask specific questions about restaurant menus, cuisines, dietary options, prices, and more — with **real menu photos** attached for cross-checking maximum data accuracy!

## Problem Statement

Traditional search engines struggle to answer nuanced restaurant queries like:

- "Which restaurant has the best vegetarian options in their menu?"
- "Does ABC restaurant have gluten-free appetizers?"
- "What's the price range for XYZ restaurant's dessert menu?"
- "Compare the spice levels mentioned in the menus of restaurants A and B."

**My solution:**  
Build an AI Assistant that can:

1. Collect real restaurant menu data (including photos) via web scraping.
2. Store and organize the data using **ChromaDB** and **HuggingFace Embeddings**.
3. Process and retrieve context intelligently through an **Agentic RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
4. Handle both context-based queries and out-of-context queries seamlessly.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone hhttps://github.com/pranayyb/Nugget-GenAI.git
cd Nugget-GenAI
```

2. First, create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file and add your Groq API key:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

5. Make sure the `chroma_db/` directory exists and contains real restaurant menu data.

   - If it doesn't exist, you can generate your own dataset by running `scrape.py` to collect the menu data, followed by `upload.py` to upload it into ChromaDB.

6. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## How it Works

- User asks a dining-related question.
- Chat history and current question are processed to reformulate into a standalone query.
- RAG system searches the ChromaDB for relevant documents.
- If the answer is not found, fallback to Wikipedia search.
- Final answer is generated by Groq's LLaMA-3.3-70B model.
- The assistant also handles rate limits automatically with retries.
